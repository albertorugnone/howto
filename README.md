#Future work
We are at the really beginning. Infact this set of howto is quite empty :-)

The first step will be define the environment, then

- how to work locally using markdown in effective way
- how to link this to a blog
- how to write a blog using markdown and then
- how to link this repository to a gitbook.

They are simple how that will be ready in the next release.
